# Procedural Forest Walking Simulation

# About

This project utilizes procedural generation techniques to create a dynamic and immersive forest environment. The forest is procedurally grown, with textured trees and plants, and the scene is lit with realistic lighting and shadows. Players can interact with the environment by highlighting objects with the mouse, and the simulation includes time-based lighting changes to simulate the passage of the day and night cycle.
